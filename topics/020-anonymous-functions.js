// you might have noticed some new things about the above function:
/*
    * We used an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE): (function() { ... })()
    * The outer function is invoked immediately, so the result of that IIFE call is directly assigned to SUM.
    * In other words, SUM ends up being the inner function itself (the one that does the summation).
    * Therefore, when you call SUM(1,2,3,4,5), youâ€™re actually calling the summation function, which returns 15.
*/

// how IIFE works?
/*
    1- We wrap the function in parentheses: (function () { //... })
    This transforms the `function declaration` into a `function expression`.

    2- We call it immediately by adding () after it: (function () { //... })();
    This ensures that the function is executed right away, rather than defining it and waiting for a later call.

    Why people use IIFE?
    You might need to do a search for better and more complete answer, but:
    * Avoid pulluting the global scope as everything declared inside IIFE exists only in the local scope
    * Sometimes you have code that should run only once (eg., setup)
    * By returning an inner function from the IIFE (or otherwise capturing variables), you can create
        closures that `remember` state without exposing it globally. (interesting!)
