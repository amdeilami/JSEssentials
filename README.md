# JSEssentials
Writing down java script essentials as I learn it from zero

## File naming convention
I use kebab-case convention for naming files (all lowercase, separate words by hyphen)

## Environment
You can run each .js file with `node file-name.js`
I'm using ubuntu, you can find instructions on how to install the latest (preferably LTS) nodejs on your device
