# JSEssentials
Writing down java script essentials as various scripts in the [topics](./topics/) directory. Most of the contents are based on a video from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) which I really recommend to follow.

## Who's this repository for?
If you are an absolute beginner in programming, you might find this a litte bit challenging as it may arise several questions for you along the path. If you are already familiar with programming and want to review javascript or learn it, it can be a good source for you. You don't have to search through a video or various websites for different topics, you just need to follow the scripts based on their number (Even this is not necessary though!)

## Environment
You can run each `.js` file with `node file-name.js`
I'm using Ubuntu, you can find instructions on how to install the latest (preferably LTS) `nodejs` on your machine.

## [topics](./topics/)
contains a series of scripts each with enough comments to explain new concepts and common questions.

## [problems](./problems/)
contains a set of problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), each containing a question description and a tested solution.

## File naming convention
I use kebab-case convention for naming files (all lowercase, separate words by hyphen)

## Running each script
You might find several lines of ouput when running each of the scripts, feel free to change to code such that it would be easier for you to focus on a specific output instead of all other ones.
